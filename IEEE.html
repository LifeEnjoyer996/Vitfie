            <h2>üìùAbout US</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">IEEE is a college club that focuses on coding and research in the fields of
                electrical engineering, computer science, and related disciplines. The club is a student-run
                organization that provides members with opportunities to develop their technical skills, network with
                professionals in the field, and gain experience in research and development.</p>

            <P style="font-size: 20px;">The IEEE club is part of a larger international organization of the same name,
                which has more than 400,000 members in over 160 countries. The club is dedicated to advancing technology
                for the benefit of humanity, and it is committed to promoting education, research, and innovation in the
                field of electrical and computer engineering.</P>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club's primary focus is on coding and research, and it offers a variety of
                activities and events for members to participate in. The club hosts workshops, seminars, and coding
                competitions to help members improve their skills and gain practical experience. Members also have the
                opportunity to work on research projects, either independently or as part of a team, and present their
                findings at conferences and competitions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club is open to all students, regardless of their major or field of study.
                Members can participate in a variety of subcommittees, such as coding, research, and outreach. The
                coding subcommittee focuses on coding challenges, hackathons, and coding workshops to help members
                improve their coding skills. The research subcommittee offers opportunities for members to work on
                research projects, either independently or as part of a team. The outreach subcommittee is responsible
                for organizing events to promote STEM education and careers to high school and middle school students in
                the local community.</p>
