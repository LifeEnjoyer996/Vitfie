            <h2>üìùAbout US</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">TEAM Griffin is a college club dedicated to the design and construction of
                unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The club comprises a team of experienced students who are assigned to
                various domains and work together to bring their models to reality. The club's goal is to design and
                build UAVs that are efficient, effective, and affordable, while also contributing to the advancement of
                technology.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club's experienced team has a diverse set of skills and knowledge, including
                expertise in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer
                science. This multidisciplinary team works cohesively to design and build UAVs that are capable of
                performing a wide range of tasks, from surveillance and reconnaissance to cargo delivery and search and
                rescue operations.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">All analysis is done in-house to ensure that the design is validated and meets
                the necessary specifications. The team uses various software tools to simulate and analyze the
                performance of their models, such as CAD software for 3D modeling and simulation, as well as specialized
                software for aerodynamic analysis and flight simulation. This analysis helps the team to optimize their
                designs for maximum efficiency and performance.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Once the design has been validated, the team hands it over to the manufacturing
                and avionics experts to produce the aircraft. The manufacturing team is responsible for sourcing
                materials, building the airframe, and installing the necessary components, such as the propulsion
                system, control surfaces, and avionics. The avionics team is responsible for designing and integrating
                the onboard electronics, such as the autopilot, sensors, and communication systems.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club is actively involved in various competitions and events related to UAV
                design and construction. These competitions provide an excellent opportunity for the club members to
                showcase their skills, network with industry professionals, and learn from other teams. The club has won
                several awards and accolades for its innovative designs and outstanding performance in these
                competitions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, TEAM Griffin is an excellent opportunity for students interested in
                aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to gain
                hands-on experience in UAV design and construction. The club's multidisciplinary team and in-house
                analysis capabilities provide students with a unique opportunity to work collaboratively and bring their
                designs to reality. The club's participation in competitions and events also provides students with
                opportunities to showcase their skills, learn from others, and contribute to the advancement of
                technology.</p>
