            <h2>üìùAbout US</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The International Society of Automation (ISA) is a college club that focuses on
                the fields of automation and control systems engineering. The club is part of a larger international
                organization of the same name, which has more than 40,000 members in over 100 countries. The club is
                dedicated to advancing the fields of automation and control systems engineering through education,
                training, and networking.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The ISA club offers a variety of activities and events for members to
                participate in. These include technical talks, workshops, and hands-on training sessions, which are
                designed to help members develop their technical skills and learn about the latest trends and
                technologies in the field. Members also have the opportunity to work on research projects, either
                independently or as part of a team, and present their findings at conferences and competitions.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club is open to all students, regardless of their major or field of study.
                Members can participate in a variety of subcommittees, such as programming, robotics, and process
                control. The programming subcommittee focuses on software development and coding challenges to help
                members improve their programming skills. The robotics subcommittee offers opportunities for members to
                design and build robots and other automated systems, while the process control subcommittee focuses on
                the design and operation of industrial processes.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">One of the key benefits of joining the ISA club is the opportunity to network
                with professionals in the field. Members have the opportunity to attend conferences and industry events,
                where they can learn about the latest trends and technologies in the field, and meet potential employers
                and collaborators. The club also offers mentorship programs and career development resources to help
                members navigate their career paths and find job opportunities in the field.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">In addition to its technical focus, the ISA club is also dedicated to promoting
                diversity and inclusion in the field of automation and control systems engineering. The club encourages
                participation from underrepresented groups and provides support and resources to help members from
                diverse backgrounds succeed in the field.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Joining the ISA club is an excellent opportunity for students who are interested
                in automation and control systems engineering to gain practical experience, develop their skills, and
                network with professionals in the field. The club provides a supportive community for students who share
                a passion for technology, and it is a great way to get involved in research and development projects. By
                participating in ISA events and activities, members can gain valuable experience and knowledge that can
                help them succeed in their careers in the future.</p>
