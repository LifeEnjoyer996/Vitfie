            <h2>üìùAbout US</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Mirage is a college club that was established in Pune, India, in 2009. It is a
                campus film society that aims to promote the appreciation of cinema among students and encourage
                critical thinking about the art of filmmaking. Mirage is affiliated with the Federation of Film
                Societies of India (FFSI), a national organization that promotes the growth of film societies in the
                country.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The club has a diverse membership base, consisting of students from different
                departments and backgrounds. The members share a common passion for cinema and are committed to
                organizing screenings, discussions, workshops, and other film-related events on the campus.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Mirage's primary objective is to provide a platform for students to explore and
                understand cinema as an art form. To achieve this, the club organizes regular film screenings, both
                classic and contemporary, from different genres and countries. The screenings are followed by
                interactive discussions where members can share their thoughts and opinions on the film. The club also
                invites experts from the film industry, such as directors, producers, and actors, to conduct workshops
                and talks on different aspects of filmmaking.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">In addition to organizing film screenings and discussions, Mirage also
                participates in various film festivals and competitions. The club has won several awards for its short
                films and documentaries at national and international film festivals. The members also attend film
                festivals and events outside the campus to gain exposure to different cinematic experiences.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Mirage has been successful in creating a community of film enthusiasts on the
                campus. The club has fostered a sense of camaraderie among its members and has provided them with a
                creative outlet to express themselves through the medium of cinema. It has also helped students to
                develop critical thinking skills and appreciate the nuances of storytelling and visual communication.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, Mirage is a vibrant and dynamic campus film society that has made
                significant contributions to the cultural life of Pune. Its affiliation with the FFSI has helped it to
                connect with other film societies across the country and to promote the appreciation of cinema on a
                larger scale.</p>
